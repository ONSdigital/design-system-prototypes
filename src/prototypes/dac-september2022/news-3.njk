                <p>The Office for National Statistics launched the first step of the Integrated Data Service (IDS) today. The IDS is website for analysts and researchers to get better access to data from a range of sources.</p>

                <p>This first version will allow government analysts to compare data from the ONS with other departments. This will help inform policy decisions and encourage collaboration across government.</p>

                <p>The service will launch next spring and be available to accredited researchers outside of government.</p>

                <p>The three projects selected for the first phase will focus on some of the government’s top priorities:</p>

                {{

                                "text": '<p>wage growth - an ONS and HM Treasury collaboration will look in detail at how wages change across the country. This will help inform the government’s “Levelling Up” policy agenda</p>'

                            {
                                "text": '<p>energy efficiency - we will work with the Valuation Office Agency to provide better information on the energy efficiency of homes around the country. This is part of wider work to help measure the UK’s progress towards reaching net zero by 2050</p>'
                            },
                            {
                                "text": '<p>regional issues - we will work with the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy to look at how text from local news sources across the UK can be used to understand concerns of communities around the country</p>'
                            }
                        ]
                    })
                }}

                <p>DCMS Minister for State Julia Lopez said: "The Integrated Data Service is a crucial part of our National Data Strategy and will make it easier and quicker for policy makers to access robust evidence for making the decisions that can improve the lives of people across the country.</p>

                <p>"Unlocking the power of data will boost the economy, create jobs and help us build back better from the pandemic.”</p>

                <p>Joanna Davinson is the Executive Director at the Central Digital and Data Office. She said: “The Integrated Data Service will give the public sector high-quality data for better research and analysis.</p>

                <p>“This is in line with our vision of having more available data for decision-makers to ensure better policies. We can transform how the Government uses data, and support the delivery of better public services for everyone.”</p>

                <p>Alison Pritchard is the Deputy National Statistician for Data Capability. She said: "The Service demonstrates how data held, managed and accessed in a trusted and secure environment can benefit us all by providing essential insight on social and economic factors. I am particularly looking forward to engaging widely to explain how we are protecting the data appropriately and making sure it is put to use for the public good."</p>
